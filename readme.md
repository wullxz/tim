Time Is Money - time tracking &amp; invoice hacking

# message for TALIMA!

if you happen to have a look at my code, don't hesitate to ask if you don't understand anything ^^

# about
I started this project to practice some nodejs for myself and to create a tool for time tracking my other projects.
It is inspired by [substacks clocker project](https://github.com/substack/clocker).

# features

- manage clients (currently implemented: add a client)
- track times for clients
- combine tracked times into invoice line items (translated that with 'invoice position' because I'm german ^^)
- combine invoice line items to invoices
- automatically create invoice pdfs (to be implemented until end of jan 2016)
- automatically send those invoice pdfs to clients (requires an email saved with the client record - to be implemented until end of jan 2016)

# how to use it
You need nodejs/npm to be installed on your system and then run:
```
git clone https://github.com/wullxz/tim
cd tim
npm link

tim help
```

You might need to run `npm link` as administrator/superuser.

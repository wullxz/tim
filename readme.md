Time Is Money - time tracking &amp; invoice hacking

# about
I started this project to practice some nodejs for myself and to create a tool for time tracking my other projects.
It is inspired by [substacks clocker project](https://github.com/substack/clocker).

# howto use it
You need nodejs/npm to be installed on your system and then run:
```
git clone https://github.com/wullxz/tim
cd tim
npm link
```

You might need to run `npm link` as administrator/superuser.
